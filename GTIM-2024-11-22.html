    <h1>GTIM Equity Research Report</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 22, 2024</p>

    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>My current stance on GTIM is neutral. While there is potential for upside if management successfully stabilizes same-store sales trends and executes a strategic turnaround, the company’s persistent operational inefficiencies and competitive pressures leave its long-term prospects uncertain. With valuation sensitivities tied closely to upcoming results and institutional behavior, I believe the risk-reward balance remains evenly poised at this time.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>GTIM’s 2021 tender offer, priced at $4.50 per share, implies a market capitalization of $44.7M using today’s shares outstanding. With the current market cap at only $28.5M, this reflects a destruction of ~$16M in shareholder value, underscoring the failure of management’s capital allocation strategy.</li>
        <li>The $6.5M earmarked for the tender offer represented a significant opportunity cost, as these funds could have been used to expand Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar, invest in automation, or rebrand Good Times Burgers.</li>
        <li>Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar offers a path forward, with a proven record of growth and unit-level profitability, but success hinges on strategic expansion and operational optimization.</li>
        <li>Institutional holder concentration poses significant risks, with 8.8% of outstanding shares held by institutions.</li>
        <li>Without decisive action, GTIM risks further stagnation and potential declines below $2 per share.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Capital Structure</h2>
    <p>GTIM’s capital structure reflects modest liquidity but concerning inefficiencies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Price $2.65 </li>
        <li>Shares $10.8M Q324 </li>
        <li>Cash $4.8M Q324 </li>
        <li>Debt $1.1M Q324</li>
        <li>$24.8M in Enterprise Value</li>
        <li>GTIM has required $3.20 in investor funds to produce $1 in losses, a stark indicator of capital inefficiency.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As of the company’s Q3-24 filing, GTIM’s market cap is $28.5M. The company has cash of $4.8M and total debt of $1.1M, imputing an Enterprise Value of $24.8M.</p>
    <p>The $1.1M debt stems primarily from the Cadence Credit Facility, a loan agreement capped at $8M with a maturity date of 4/20/28. This facility includes a weighted average interest rate of 8.42% (as of 6/25/24) and a 0.25% fee on unused portions of the loan. Currently, GTIM has borrowed $750K and issued $10K in letters of credit, leaving $7.24M available. However, borrowing more than $4M (>50% of the facility) triggers stricter financial covenants, limiting the company’s ability to spend on growth or shareholder payouts. Additionally, GTIM has incurred $299K in origination fees, with $102K still unamortized as of 6/24/24. The facility is secured by a 1st priority lien on all company assets.</p>
    <p>The Parker Promissory Note represents an additional unsecured liability related to the acquisition of Good Times Burgers. This loan is fully amortized over 10 years at a 5% annual interest rate, with an outstanding balance of $380K as of 6/25/24. Combined, these debts total $1.13M.</p>
    <p>The high borrowing costs (8.42% average interest) and limited available credit leave GTIM with minimal financial flexibility. To navigate these constraints, the company must prioritize operational efficiency and disciplined capital allocation, focusing on initiatives that deliver measurable returns.</p>
    <img src="capital_structure_chart.png" alt="Capital Structure Chart" style="max-width:50%; height:auto;">
    <p>Lastly, since its inception, GTIM has required $3.20 of investor capital to produce $1 in losses, reflecting significant inefficiencies in the company’s operations and capital allocation.</p>

    <h2>Growth</h2>
    <p>Plans never materialize when you play Russian roulette with shareholder capital. What happened to the Good Times? Over the past 13 years, GTIM achieved 17% average revenue growth, driven primarily by Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar. In contrast, Good Times Burgers stagnated with growth roughly flat over the past 7 years, reflecting a decline in customer demand and operational relevance.</p>
    <p>To sustain growth, GTIM must focus on expanding Bad Daddy’s while reevaluating Good Times Burgers’ future.</p>
    <img src="growth_over_time.png" alt="Growth Over Time" style="max-width:50%; height:auto;">

    <h2>SSS Trend</h2>
    <p>The performance of Good Times Restaurants Inc. demonstrates the stark divergence between its two brands. Bad Daddy’s experienced strong growth post-COVID, peaking at 24.0% in Q122. However, growth declined to 15.5% in Q222 and further to 5.3% by Q322, reflecting normalization in demand and possibly macroeconomic pressures. Growth briefly turned negative in Q323 (-1.4%) before stabilizing at low single-digit levels by Q424 (2.9%). This indicates resilience but also highlights challenges in sustaining momentum.</p>
    <p>Good Times Burgers, by contrast, showed more erratic performance. From negative growth (-2.5%) in Q122, it briefly improved to 7.6% in Q223 before returning to volatile, flat, or negative growth, ending Q424 at -0.1%. This pattern underscores operational challenges, including difficulty attracting traffic and maintaining pricing power in a highly competitive QSR environment.</p>
    <img src="same_store_sales.png" alt="Same Store Sales" style="max-width:50%; height:auto;">

    <h2>Operations</h2>
    <p>The "Restaurant Expenses as % of Total Revenue" chart highlights the stability of GTIM's major expense categories over the past decade, with total operating costs largely unchanged as a percentage of revenue. Food/Packaging Costs and Payroll/Other Costs consistently account for the largest shares of expenses, at 31%-34% and 30%-35%, respectively.</p>
    <p>While expense ratios have remained steady, the company has failed to achieve meaningful reductions in its largest cost drivers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Food/Packaging Costs: Minimal fluctuation suggests limited success in renegotiating supplier contracts or reducing waste.</li>
        <li>Payroll Costs: Remaining flat at ~32% highlights inefficiencies in labor management, particularly as the broader industry embraces automation and flexible staffing solutions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Despite achieving some cost stability, the company must tackle these opportunities to improve margins and build resilience against external economic pressures.</p>
    <img src="restaurant_expenses.png" alt="Restaurant Expenses as % of Revenue" style="max-width:50%; height:auto;">

    <h2>Revenue Growth Vs. Restaurant Margins</h2>
    <p>The Y/Y Revenue Growth vs. Restaurant Margins chart highlights the company's dependence on revenue growth to maintain profitability. Margins consistently improve during periods of high revenue growth, as seen in 2015 and 2016, where growth exceeded 50% and margins approached 20%. However, when revenue growth stagnates or declines, as in 2020 and 2023, margins contract sharply, reflecting the company's inability to adjust its cost structure to lower sales volumes.</p>
    <img src="revenue_growth.png" alt="Y/Y Revenue Growth Vs. Restaurant Margins" style="max-width:50%; height:auto;">

    <h2>Margin Specific</h2>
    <p>Over the past 13 years, restaurant margins have mostly ranged between 14%-18% in 7 out of 13 years, with only 3 years achieving margins between 18%-22%. Margins in this higher range were driven primarily by extraordinary revenue growth, such as the 57% spike in 2015 and 46% in 2016. Without such growth, margins tend to fall below 18%, as expenses often grow in tandem with or outpace revenue, as illustrated in the "Distribution of Restaurant Margins" chart.</p>
    <img src="restaurant_margins_distributions.png" alt="Distribution of Restaurant Margins" style="max-width:50%; height:auto;">

    <h2>Free Cash Flow</h2>
    <p>While recent improvements in Free Cash Flow (FCF) are promising, the historical challenges raise questions about GTIM’s ability to sustain growth. Positive FCF since 2020 reflects operational discipline, but modest levels in 2022-2023 suggest a fragile recovery. Monitoring Capex and operational efficiency will be key to long-term stability. A sustained improvement in FCF will be critical to funding strategic initiatives such as automation, rebranding, and expansion of Bad Daddy’s.</p>

    <h2>Recent News</h2>
    <p>8-K filed 10/15/24: SSS decreased -0.1% for Good Times and increased 3.2% for Bad Daddy’s. Prior year SSS increased 2.9% and decreased 1.2% for Good Times and Bad Daddy’s respectively. The CEO Ryan Zink has stated that the business cannot compete with competition.</p>
    <p>Ryan Zink, President and CEO, said “Our Good Times brand has been negatively impacted by the return of deep discounting in the quick-service environment. We remain committed to our quality position and cannot match the low-price points of the mass market competition.”</p>

    <h2>Valuation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Revenue Growth:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The upper bound ($2.70) assumes a 9% average annual revenue growth over the next 10 years, reflecting potential success from strategic initiatives, particularly if Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar becomes a larger driver of growth.</li>
                <li>The lower bound ($2.11) assumes a more conservative 5% annual growth rate, aligned with current SSS struggles and heightened competition.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Expense Trends:</strong> GTIM's current expense structure is projected using historical data, maintaining restaurant expenses (including advertising) as a percentage of revenue. This reflects the company’s ongoing inefficiency in scaling operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest Income/Expense:</strong> Interest income is calculated by applying a net return assumption of at least 1% above interest expense on GTIM’s growing net cash balance (ending net cash plus annual net income). This approach accounts for management's ability to manage surplus cash effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Depreciation and Amortization (D&A):</strong> D&A is treated as a real expense due to GTIM's lack of operational scale and its need for continuous reinvestment to sustain operations or execute a turnaround strategy.</li>
        <li><strong>Terminal Value:</strong> A -1% terminal growth rate reflects expectations of long-term contraction if current inefficiencies persist and strategic improvements fail to materialize.</li>
        <li><strong>Discount Rate:</strong> Future cash flows are discounted at approximately 9%, in line with GTIM's weighted average borrowing cost under its credit facility. This reflects the company’s risk profile and financial structure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The valuation is highly sensitive to two key factors:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Q4 FY25 Results:</strong> A significant miss in revenue, margins, or SSS trends could erode institutional confidence, prompting sell-offs in a stock with already limited liquidity.</li>
        <li><strong>Institutional Behavior Post-Results:</strong> If major holders reduce their stakes, GTIM’s stock could face additional downward pressure, with insufficient retail demand to stabilize its valuation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>GTIM's current valuation is precarious, heavily reliant on management's ability to drive strategic improvements and stabilize SSS trends. While an upper valuation of $2.70 per share assumes aggressive revenue growth and disciplined cost management, the lower bound of $2.11 reflects the risk of continued stagnation and shrinking market relevance.</p>
    <p>Unless management implements a compelling turnaround strategy or explores a strategic sale, GTIM remains vulnerable to downside risks.</p>

    <h2>Additional Material</h2>
    <p>In the company's quarterly filing (Report Date: 6/28/22), a typographical error was observed: '1.66%%'. While such minor errors may seem trivial, they can suggest broader lapses in the review process and raise concerns about the company’s attention to detail in financial reporting.</p>
    <img src="typo_in_filing.png" alt="Type in Filing" style="max-width:50%; height:auto;">
    <p>Even small mistakes in filings can undermine confidence among investors and stakeholders, particularly when accuracy is essential for decision-making and regulatory compliance. Such issues may reflect broader inefficiencies or insufficient quality control measures within the organization.</p>

    <h2>Institutional Risk</h2>
    <p>Low average trading volume (9.8K shares/day) and concentrated institutional ownership (~8.8%) create risks of significant stock price declines if major shareholders exit. For example, Renaissance Technologies holds 271,083 shares (~2.51%), requiring 28 trading days to exit, potentially causing a 5-12.5% price impact. This concentration of ownership creates vulnerability. Should any of these institutions decide to liquidate their positions, GTIM’s limited liquidity could trigger significant downward pressure on the stock price.</p>

    <img src="institutional_holdings.png" alt="Institutional Holdings" style="max-width:50%; height:auto;">

    <h2>Final Recommendation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Divest Good Times Burgers: Free up resources to focus on Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar, the company’s proven growth driver. If a singular focus on Bad Daddy’s is not feasible, management should explore a strategic sale of the entire company to maximize shareholder value.</li>
        <li>Double Down on Bad Daddy’s: Optimize operations, expand strategically, and refresh branding to strengthen the brand's positioning in the competitive casual dining market. Focus resources on high-performing locations and leverage Bad Daddy’s proven unit-level profitability.</li>
        <li>Invest in Technology: Reduce costs and improve efficiency through automation and data analytics. Enhancements in Point-of-Sale systems and kitchen automation can streamline operations, improve customer experience, and drive margin expansion.</li>
        <li>Focus on Financial Discipline: Use proceeds from divestitures or a potential sale to pay down debt, strengthen the balance sheet, and fund strategic growth initiatives. A disciplined approach to capital allocation is critical for long-term value creation.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Supplementary Analysis: Options and Market Activity</h2>
    <p>Currently, 385 put contracts have been traded at a $2.50 strike price (expiration: Dec 20, 2024), reflecting a significant level of activity on the bearish side. This could indicate that investors suspect the stock price may fall below $2.50, making these options profitable. If institutional investors exit their positions, this could pressure the stock price downward, potentially validating this bearish outlook. However, if the business remains stable and the stock price stays above $2.50, these options will likely expire worthless.</p>
    <p>On the bullish side, only 15 call contracts have been traded at the $2.50 strike price. This relatively low volume suggests limited interest or optimism in the stock’s upward potential at this level, especially when compared to the notable activity on the put side. While these call options are currently in the money with the stock price at $2.65, whether they can be sold at a profit depends on the premium originally paid for the options. If the premium exceeds the intrinsic value of $0.15 per share, the holder may not yet realize a profit.</p>
    <p><strong>Punchline:</strong> This imbalance in options activity highlights bearish sentiment driven by GTIM’s operational inefficiencies and institutional risks—an urgent call for management to address these issues.</p>
